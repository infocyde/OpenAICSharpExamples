# OpenAICSharpExamples

This is just a really basic example of using OpenAI via their API.  I will add features as I have time and clean things up.

You will need to supply your own API key which you can obtain from OpenAI.com.  Put your API key in the top of the OpenAI.cs class

This is a windows form app that wraps around a few classes (the classes are what you want).  This is written in .net 4.6.1 (so you can copy a folder with the program onto any Windows 10/11 box and it should work without an installer).  

It should work with other versions of .net, but I haven't tested it.

There are also some c# SDKs that might offer some cool features.  The are not necessary though.

Have fun.
